This is all very experimental.

Configuration might look like:

  {rabbit_federation,
   [ {exchanges, [{ %% local exchange people can bind to
                   "local",
                    %% remote exchange they effectively bind to
                   "amqp://amqp.example.com/%2f/remote",
                    %% type of remote exchange
                   "direct"}]
     }
   ]}
