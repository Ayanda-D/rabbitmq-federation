Necessary
---------

Cycle detection / log route
Exponential(?) backoff
Allow downstream exchange to be durable
Close remaining channels on shutdown
Validate args
Change downstream spec to (local) URL or otherwise handle vhosts
Test / fix with alternate PLAIN creds
Be smarter about bind / unbind
Deal with downstream channel going down

Useful
------

Deal with upstream exchange going away / coming back?
Remove that ETS table
Allow use of EXTERNAL etc

Later
-----

Message transformation (e.g. transient to persistent)?
Add / remove upstreams dynamically
Automated federate-all-exchanges mode
Figure out if there's a more efficient way to make e2e work with this.
Dedup mode (likely to be slow)
