Necessary
---------

Cycle detection
Exponential(?) backoff
Close remaining channels on shutdown
Test / fix with alternate PLAIN creds
Deal with downstream channel going down
Think about when we forward - connected graph of brokers/exchanges.
   Cycle detection is not enough.

Useful
------

Deal with upstream exchange going away / coming back?
Remove that ETS table
Allow use of EXTERNAL etc
Allow args passthrough to support e.g. headers type.
Be smarter about bind (for efficiency)

Later
-----

Message transformation (e.g. transient to persistent)?
Add / remove upstreams dynamically
Automated federate-all-exchanges mode
Figure out if there's a more efficient way to make e2e work with this.
Dedup mode (likely to be slow)
