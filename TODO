Critical
--------

Do something about uri_parser clash with shovel


Important
---------

Configurable backoff
Remove that DETS table
  Fix in cluster
Be smarter about bind (for efficiency)
Be even smarter about unbind (for efficiency)
Handle user-id somehow
Configurable queue lifetime / prefetch count / heartbeat(?)

Useful
------

Deal with upstream exchange going away / coming back?
Allow args passthrough to support e.g. headers type.
Think about when we forward - partly connected graph of brokers/exchanges.
   Cycle detection is not enough (it's certainly a start though).
   Introduce outgoing federation exchange at the upstream end to do filtering.

Later
-----

Message transformation (e.g. transient to persistent)?
Add / remove upstreams dynamically
Automated federate-all-exchanges mode
Figure out if there's a more efficient way to make e2e work with this.
Dedup mode (likely to be slow)
